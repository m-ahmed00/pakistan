            <h2>Pak ARMY</h2>
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OfficialPakArmy" target="_blank">pak army</a>
           <b> <p>The Pakistan Army (Urdu: پاک فوج) is the branch of the Pakistani Armed Forces responsible for land-based military
             operations. It is the largest and oldest established branch of the Pakistani military and is one of three uniformed services.
              The Pakistan Army came into existence after the Partition of India and the resulting independence of Pakistan in 1947. It is 
              currently headed by General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. The Pakistan Army is a volunteer professional fighting force.[3] It has an 
              active force of 550,000 personnel.[1] The Pakistani constitution contains a provision for conscription, but it has never been imposed.</p></b>

                <h2>Pak Navy</h2>
                <b><p>Pakistan Navy is a four dimensional force of Pakistan, but was neglected due to unawareness of political think tanks of Pakistan regarding the geopolitical importance of Pakistani coastal belt and the due role of Pakistan Navy in its best utilization. Pakistan navy nowadays is going through major and effective changes in order to rise as a regional force. Since the birth of Pakistan, Navy has proved its effectiveness and efficiency at all times.

                    	Pakistan Navy has a defined mission and Vision to defend its Exclusive Economic Zone, offshore economic resources, Sea Lines of Communication and to protect its merchant fleet which is important for the trade of Pakistan, as most of the trade of Pakistan is through the sea. In this regard Pakistan Navy has undergone resources development and improved its tactics and strategies. Pakistan Navy has emerged as major stakeholder in maintaining regional maritime security in the upcoming years being a vigilant and capable naval force.
                    
                    	The risk of a blockade has remained vital point of consideration to the PN strategic thinking. Pakistan learnt this lesson from the devastation of the 1971 war, when despite the PN placing its surface fleet along Pakistan shores in attempt to deny Indian naval forces, Indian missile boats were able to hit Karachi. But this was not seen, so much as a letdown of the sea denial strategy, as it was interpreted to be a case of insufficient resources in protecting Pakistan coast. Since then, Pakistan has placed a special importance on mounting maritime reconnaissance and sub-surface warfare proficiency to alleviate the threat of a blockade off Karachi.

            <h3>Pakistan</h3>
            <b><p>Pakistan means ‘Land of Pure’ in Urdu and Persian. The official name of my country is the ‘Islamic Republic of Pakistan’. The majority of peoples are Muslims here in this country. It is a democratic country. Pakistan has a growing economy with a powerful military.

                People are so much friendly here. Now tourism is developing and lots of foreign’s tourists are visiting our country regularly. It is a very big country divides by 5 provinces and a few special areas. I love to live here because I born here.
                
                When I go away from Pakistan I miss my country a lot and I can feel a deep connection with my motherland at that time. I know everyone has that patriotism to love their own country and it comes naturally.
                
                The national anthem of Pakistan is ‘Pak Sarzamin’ or ‘The Sacred Land’. It is beautiful music that helps me to feel my country. I love Pakistan a lot. I wish to have a better situation for our economy and tourism.</p></b>
